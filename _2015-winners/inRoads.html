# Description of why they won
winning_description: |
  <p>Like most cities, Bloomington keeps a detailed database of road, sidewalk and parking events. These events - closings, lane reductions, reservations and noise permits - are authorized by the Board of Public Works. But the people who need to know about these events are the people of Bloomington.</p>
  <p>InRoads is an open source, digital service developed by the City that manages all of this information so it can be useful. And, like many of the other technologies we’ve seen today, it’s also hosted on Github.</p>
  <p>By bringing together employee processes, systems, and information that used to be stored separately, employees can understand and see parking events now and in the future - helping them make better decisions and spot problems before they happen.</p>
  <p>InRoads also saves time. Automatically publishing road closure information and sharing it with the press every week frees up an extra four hours for the employee responsible for that information.</p>
  <p>In Bloomington, our judges saw a forward-looking technology department that understands how to build services that meet their user’s needs. With InRoads, the city has a platform to automatically share information with services like Google Maps and Waze to help users plan better routes in the future.</p>
