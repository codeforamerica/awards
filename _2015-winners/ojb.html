# Description of why they won
winning_description: |
  <p>Of all the systems managed by government, the one we desperately need to be smarter is the justice system. But to be fair and to make smart decisions, many parts of government - from our police to our prosecutors, from our courts to our corrections officers - must work together with up-to-date, accurate information. This is difficult because the information one part of the justice system needs is often controlled by another.</p>
  <p>Without automatic, integrated information sharing systems, the people working in our justice system can’t make decisions living up to the responsibility of delivering fair, effective and evidence-based justice for all. Unfortunately, there aren’t that many good options. Commercial integration platforms cost a lot, and each jurisdiction usually spends time and money on the hard work of rebuilding interfaces.</p>
  <p>Open Justice Broker, from the Open Justice Broker Consortium, meets a clear need for inexpensive, integrated justice technology. Open Justice Broker is already being used in Hawaii, Maine, Vermont and Michigan. The information sharing it makes possible is already making a difference. Probation violations have fallen in Vermont, because supervised individuals now know that officers will be instantly notified about any law enforcement contact they have.</p>
  <p>An open source, extensible platform available on Github means that new features developed by one jurisdiction, like arrest notifications, can be quickly and affordably used by other jurisdictions.</p>
  <p>We’re proud to recognize Open Justice Broker for showing how open, user-centered technology makes a difference for the people working in the justice community - and the citizens they serve.</p>
