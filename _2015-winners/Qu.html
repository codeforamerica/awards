  <p>Qu is an open source data platform created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to easily serve large sets of data. It was originally created to serve data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act but it isn’t just for HMDA; it’s a free and open source platform that anyone can use to build their own data APIs.</p>
  <p>It lets users query complex data, combine it with other data, and summarize that data. Instead of building a single-purpose application, the CFPB built a reusable, extensible platform that can be used by any organization to create a REST API for large amounts of information, allowing the public to get the raw information or create aggregations for their own use. Qu includes an ETL pipeline for ingesting data and a Socrata Open Data API-inspired REST interface. Qu was created with Clojure, JavaScript, and MongoDB by a team of developers, UI designers, and system engineers.</p>
