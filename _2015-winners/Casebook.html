  <p>&quot;We are honored to be recognized by Code for America for the work Case Commons is doing to transform child welfare services technology. More and more state leaders are recognizing the need for innovative technology – like Casebook – to drive better data, policy and practice. This award will raise awareness about the value Casebook provides and the critical need for states to adopt technology that better supports everyone from the front office to the front lines. Casebook puts improved outcomes for the most vulnerable children and families within reach, even as it accelerates the transformation and integration of 21st century human services.&quot;</p>
