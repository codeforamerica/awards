  <p>Casebook is the first person- and family-centric, cloud-based case management application designed specifically to support better decision making at all levels of public child welfare agencies. Developed by Case Commons, a unique technology non-profit with support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Casebook is used by child welfare workers to manage their work, while easily capturing information about children in their care. Casebook supports child and family caseworkers by giving them mobile, user-friendly tools and valuable, real-time data to inform their decisions. By monitoring and ensuring high quality data, Casebook provides policymakers the information they need to make meaningful policy decisions. Casebook also supports integrating data with other government services to create a truly comprehensive case management system. Casebook’s contemporary design, usability and tools are transforming how casework is done, improving the quality of data, analytics and policy making – and helping improve outcomes for our country’s most disadvantaged children.</p>
