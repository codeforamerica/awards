  <p>Casebook is the first person- and family-centric, cloud-based case management application designed specifically to support better decision making at all levels of public child welfare agencies. Developed by Case Commons, a unique technology non-profit with support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Casebook is used by child welfare workers to manage their work, while easily capturing information about children in their care. Casebook supports child and family caseworkers by giving them mobile, user-friendly tools and valuable, real-time data to inform their decisions. By monitoring and ensuring high quality data, Casebook provides policymakers the information they need to make meaningful policy decisions. Casebook also supports integrating data with other government services to create a truly comprehensive case management system. Casebook’s contemporary design, usability and tools are transforming how casework is done, improving the quality of data, analytics and policy making – and helping improve outcomes for our country’s most disadvantaged children.</p>
=======
  <p>&quot;We are honored to be recognized by Code for America for the work Case Commons is doing to transform child welfare services technology. More and more state leaders are recognizing the need for innovative technology – like Casebook – to drive better data, policy and practice. This award will raise awareness about the value Casebook provides and the critical need for states to adopt technology that better supports everyone from the front office to the front lines. Casebook puts improved outcomes for the most vulnerable children and families within reach, even as it accelerates the transformation and integration of 21st century human services.&quot;</p>
