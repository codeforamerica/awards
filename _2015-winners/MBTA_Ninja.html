  <p>Inspired by the terrible weather and commuting woes of the 2015 Boston winter, MBTA Ninja is a crowdsourced alerting network for the Boston subway and commuter rail. Passengers can use their smartphones to report issues like delays, overcrowding, or disabled trains, and then view alerts posted by others in real time across the entire train system. Users can also upvote alerts to confirm them, or give the okay when things have cleared up, enabling the system to react instantaneously to rapidly changing conditions. MBTA Ninja supplements generic official emails with detailed, instant updates that reflect what subway riders are actually experiencing on the ground.</p>
