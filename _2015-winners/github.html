# Short (140 character) blurb of what the company/project does
short_marketing_blurb: "Agencies use GitHub to engage developers and collaborate with the public on open source, open data and open government efforts. GitHub even renders common formats like text, CSV, and geospatial data."

# Long (100-150 words) marketing blurb of what the company/project does
long_marketing_blurb: |
  <p>Government uses GitHub in two ways: for public engagement and for internal collaboration.</p>
  <p>GitHub provides government with a forum to get feedback from their end users, to publish data in a free, lightweight way, and to hear from the data's end users what works, what doesn't and what other data they'd like to see. Rather than investing in purpose-built tools, agencies can post data to a GitHub repository as a static file, to put it in the hand of developers, and then to make a better-informed investment decision.</p>
  <p>Additionally, GitHub facilitates internal collaboration, and can be especially useful for open source, open data, and open government efforts.</p>
