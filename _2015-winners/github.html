  <p>SeeClickFix allows citizens to play an integral role in public services — routing neighborhood concerns like potholes and light outages to the right official with the right information. This engagement has both a tangible and emotional effect — improving infrastructure, increasing understanding and building trust.</p>
  <p>To accomplish this, SeeClickFix provides an integrated platform for service request collection and management. Citizens submit requests via SeeClickFix mobile apps and website tools — city call takers enter phone calls, drop ins, emails and tweets into the SeeClickFix as well. From there, these requests are routed either manually or automatically based on location and request type, to the right person with the right information.</p>
  <p>City staff are then notified within SeeClickFix that work has been assigned. As the work is updated and subsequently closed, the citizen receives automatic updates.</p>
  <p>This process increases the total level of citizen participation as well as the perceived quality of these services. SeeClickFix also reduces the costs associated with these services by reducing phone calls, introducing automated responses and reducing the frictional costs of communication.</p>
