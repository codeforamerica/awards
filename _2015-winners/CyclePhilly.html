long_marketing_blurb: |
  <p>CyclePhilly is an open-source smartphone app and web-based project that crowdsources raw bike route choice data from bicyclists as they ride using smartphone GPS. Prior to CyclePhilly, transportation planners in the Greater Philadelphia Area were limited to  traditional census data or intersection traffic counters to plan new bicycle paths.  Without knowing route-choice, i.e. what led bikers through intersections, planners could not build infrastructure around actual biking habits. CyclePhilly fills that gap by providing exact origin, route, and destination information cross-referenced with voluntary demographic information. Using citizen-generated data, transportation planners can now accurately study bicyclist route choice, facility preference, origin-destination patterns, trip length, travel speed, and more.</p>
  <p>Data from the app is used to inform bicycle planning work, and improve bicycle forecasting capabilities to better predict bicyclist response to new investments. Knowing exact route choice preferences also proves extremely important in a City with limited resources such as Philadelphia.</p>
