    Denice Ross is a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) working on crowdsourcing initiatives at the Department of Energy, and providing support for the White House Innovation for Disaster Response and Recovery Initiative. Denice’s specialty is applying data and innovation to solve pressing real-world problems. Before becoming a PIF, she directed information strategy for the City of New Orleans, where she launched their open data initiative at data.nola.gov to support priorities such as performance management, community resilience, neighborhood revitalization, and emergency preparedness. Prior to her role in local government, Denice co-directed the nonprofit Greater New Orleans Community Data Center–work that was propelled into the national spotlight with Hurricane Katrina. Denice collaborated with Brookings to track recovery through The New Orleans Index, and also co-designed an app using “junk mail” data to visualize neighborhood repopulation. She supported many post-Katrina planning initiatives and co-founded the first new childcare center after the storm. Denice holds a BS in Biology from the University of Arizona. A New Orleanian since 2001, she now lives in the DC area with her family.
