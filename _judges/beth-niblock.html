    <p>Spend enough time with Beth Niblock, and you will understand two things clearly. One, she is earnest in her belief that transparency is the lifeblood of a healthy government. The other, she loves big challenges.</p>

    <p>As the Chief Information Officer for the City of Detroit, she was able launch GO DATA, the city’s first effort to make non-personal, public information broadly accessible to the public during her first year as CIO. She launched similar efforts as CIO for Louisville Metro, where open data also included financial details made readily available on the city’s website through services like Louisville Checkbook and LouieStat.</p>

    <p>Before coming to Detroit, Niblock was the first CIO appointed to a merged Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government in 2003. She was challenged with unifying IT systems and infrastructure, while concurrently implementing a new financial system. During her 11 years at the helm, her teams won several Best of the Web Awards and top rankings in the Digital Cities Survey. GovTech.com also recognized Niblock in 2011 as one of the nation’s top 25 Doers, Dreamers, and Drivers.</p>

    <p>Niblock was tapped by the Obama Administration to serve as part of a team of technology officials to support the City of Detroit.  That team of five was tasked with making recommendations that could support the city as it emerged from bankruptcy and beyond.</p>

    <p>It was her first introduction to Detroit; and the opportunity to come back, knowing the challenges ahead of her, was too enticing to walk away from. As the CIO for the City of Detroit, she is managing significant upgrades to infrastructure, putting systems in place to make city business transparent, launching an app for citizens to report issues with city services called Improve Detroit, and making Detroit online an easy place to do business with.</p>
